If the client really insists of us doing this epic, I would first speak with the rest of the team, asking them who would like to work overtime and cancel vacations (voluntary). There will be 2 outcomes out of this:\n1. Some team members would like to work overtime and we will have enough capacity to finish the epic.\n2. We will not have enough capacity to finish the epic in the reqested time.\nIn case of option 2, we can sit together with the client and discuss a scope reduction of other pending tasks in the next 2 sprints. Also another approach is to reduce the new epic's scope and create an MVP that can be built upon later.\nI would also advise the client that it's better to descope low priority items than to cancel vacations or work overtime, because it's a dangerous practice that risks the integrity of the team. Bottom line is that the client must know that we should prioritize long-term engagement than short-term result.",
